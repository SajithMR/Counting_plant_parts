## Counting Plant Parts(Canola Flowers and Wheat spikes)
this repo contains Code from my USRA 2019 where I adapted https://github.com/littleaich/heatmap-regulation to count canola flowers and wheat spikes. 


## Motivation
Plant breeders use many elements of a plant to use to deciside if a given verity may move on to the next bredding trial. One very use full element that can also be use for yield approxiation is counting flowers and spikes. Because of this we developed the Canola flower counting and wheat spike counting. 


## Code style
I have tried to follow the PEP coding style for this project
